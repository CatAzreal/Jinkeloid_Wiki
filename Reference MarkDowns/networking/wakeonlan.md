# Wake On LAN (WOL)

**Wake on LAN (WoL)** is a network protocol that allows a device to be powered on remotely over a network connection. It works by sending a special network message, called a magic packet, to the device's MAC address, which triggers the device to power on from a low-power state. **Wake on LAN (WoL)** is commonly used to remotely wake up computers for maintenance or to access files, among other purposes.


## Using Wake on LAN (WoL)

Some operating systems have settings that can enable or disable **Wake on LAN (WoL)** for network interfaces. For example, on [Linux](linux.md), you can use the [ethtool](ethtool.md) command to enable **Wake on LAN (WoL)** for a network interface.

Some network card drivers may have settings or options that control **Wake on LAN (WoL)** behavior. You can usually find these settings in the advanced properties or settings for the network adapter in the Device Manager on Windows or with the [ethtool](ethtool.md) command on [Linux](linux.md).

### Enabling Wake on LAN (WoL)

Enabling **Wake on LAN (WoL)** typically involves a combination of these methods, depending on the device and operating system you are using. Once **Wake on LAN (WoL)** is enabled, you can use a utility like [etherwake](etherwake.md) or `wakeonlan` to send magic packets to wake up the device remotely.
